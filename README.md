<p id="description">Smart Mental Health Chatbot: Early Intervention and Detection-

Our chatbot leverages Gamma2 9B IT and Sentence Transformer MiniLM to interact with users, assess their mental health condition, and provide appropriate suggestions. In critical cases, it also offers hotline numbers for immediate assistance.

The system uses an intents file to ensure accurate and contextually relevant responses. Currently, the chatbot supports only English communication.

We plan to introduce further improvements to enhance its capabilities and expand language support in the future.</p>
